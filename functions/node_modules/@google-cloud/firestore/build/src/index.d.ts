     * Executes the given updateFunction and commits the changes applied within
     * the transaction.
     *
     * You can use the transaction object passed to 'updateFunction' to read and
     * modify Firestore documents under lock. You have to perform all reads before
     * before you perform any write.
     *
     * Transactions can be performed as read-only or read-write transactions. By
     * default, transactions are executed in read-write mode.
     *
     * A read-write transaction obtains a pessimistic lock on all documents that
     * are read during the transaction. These locks block other transactions,
     * batched writes, and other non-transactional writes from changing that
     * document. Any writes in a read-write transactions are committed once
     * 'updateFunction' resolves, which also releases all locks.
     *
     * If a read-write transaction fails with contention, the transaction is
     * retried up to five times. The `updateFunction` is invoked once for each
     * attempt.
     *
     * Read-only transactions do not lock documents. They can be used to read
     * documents at a consistent snapshot in time, which may be up to 60 seconds
     * in the past. Read-only transactions are not retried.
     *
     * Transactions time out after 60 seconds if no documents are read.
     * Transactions that are not committed within than 270 seconds are also
     * aborted. Any remaining locks are released when a transaction times out.
