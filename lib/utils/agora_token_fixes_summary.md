# Agora Token and Supabase Function Fixes

## 1. Supabase Function: 401 Unauthorized Fix

### Problem
- Supabase Function was returning "Invalid JWT" errors because the JWT token was either missing, expired, or incorrectly formatted.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Added JWT Verification to Supabase Function**:
   - Imported the `verifyJwt` module from Supabase JWT library
   - Added proper JWT extraction and verification logic
   - Added appropriate error handling for missing or invalid tokens

2. **Updated Client-Side Authentication**:
   - Modified `call_service.dart` to always get a fresh Firebase ID token
   - Ensured proper Bearer token format in Authorization header
   - Removed hardcoded API keys from headers
   - Added better error handling for token retrieval failures

## 2. Agora Token: "Invalid Token" Fix

### Problem
- Agora tokens were being rejected due to possible issues with App ID/Certificate, token format, or other parameters.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced Token Generation Logging**:
   - Added detailed logging in both client and server code
   - Added token length validation
   - Improved error messages

2. **Created Testing Tools**:
   - Added `test_agora_token.dart` utility to test token generation
   - Created `AgoraTokenTestScreen` for easy token testing through UI
   - Added the test screen to the Developer Menu

## 3. Additional Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added proper error handling for all network requests
   - Added specific error responses for different failure scenarios

2. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the token generation process
   - Used emoji icons for better log readability
   - Added token details in logs for debugging

## How to Test the Fixes

1. Open the app in debug mode
2. Tap the developer menu icon (bottom right)
3. Select "Agora Token Test" from the menu
4. The test will:
   - Get a fresh Firebase ID token
   - Call the Supabase function with proper authentication
   - Display the results including token details or error messages

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check that `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` is properly set in your Supabase environment
2. Verify App ID and App Certificate in both client and server code
3. Use the Agora Token Generator tool to create a test token and compare
4. Check the logs for specific error messages
