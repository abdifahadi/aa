## Overview
This document contains the results of testing the Agora token generation and validation process for our video calling system. The tests cover both the Supabase Edge Function and local platform channel implementations.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Supabase Edge Function
- Added better environment variable validation
- Improved error handling and logging
- Enhanced UID handling to ensure numeric values
- Added more detailed response data

### 2. Flutter Call Service
- Improved error handling in token generation
- Added better logging for debugging
- Enhanced timeout handling
- Added more validation of response data
- Improved fallback mechanism logic

### 3. Testing Tools
- Created a dedicated token testing utility
- Implemented comprehensive test cases for both token sources
- Added UI for running tests and viewing results

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Supabase Edge Function Token Generation
- **Description**: Tests the Supabase Edge Function's ability to generate valid Agora tokens
- **Endpoint**: `https://jgfjkwtzkzctpwyqvtri.supabase.co/functions/v1/generateAgoraToken`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `channelName`: String - The name of the channel to join
  - `uid`: Number - The user ID as a number
  - `role`: String - The role (publisher or subscriber)

### 2. Local Token Generation via Platform Channel
- **Description**: Tests the local token generation using the Android platform channel
- **Method Channel**: `com.abdi_wave.abdi_wave/agora_token`
- **Parameters**:
  - `appId`: String - The Agora App ID
  - `appCertificate`: String - The Agora App Certificate
  - `channelName`: String - The name of the channel to join
  - `uid`: Number - The user ID as a number
  - `role`: Number - The role (1 for publisher, 2 for subscriber)
  - `expireTime`: Number - Token expiration time in seconds

### 3. Token Validation with Agora SDK
- **Description**: Tests if the generated tokens are accepted by the Agora SDK
- **Test Method**: Attempt to join a channel with the generated token
- **Success Criteria**: Successfully joining the channel without token errors

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Invalid Token Errors
- **Issue**: `errInvalidToken` error when joining a channel
- **Possible Causes**:
  1. Incorrect Agora App ID or Certificate
  2. UID format mismatch (string vs number)
  3. Token expiration
  4. Channel name mismatch
- **Solutions**:
  1. Verify App ID and Certificate are correctly set in both environments
  2. Ensure UID is properly converted to a number before token generation
  3. Check token expiration settings
  4. Verify channel name consistency

### Network Timeouts
- **Issue**: Requests to Supabase Edge Function timeout
- **Possible Causes**:
  1. Network connectivity issues
  2. Supabase function cold start delay
  3. Function execution taking too long
- **Solutions**:
  1. Implement proper timeout handling and fallback mechanisms
  2. Consider increasing timeout duration for first request
  3. Optimize function execution time

## Recommendations

1. **Primary Token Source**: Use Supabase Edge Function as the primary token source
2. **Fallback Strategy**: Use local token generation as fallback when Supabase is unavailable
3. **Error Handling**: Implement specific error handling for different failure scenarios
4. **Performance Optimization**: Pre-generate tokens when possible to avoid delays during call setup
5. **Environment Variables**: Ensure Supabase environment variables are properly set in production

## Next Steps

1. Monitor token generation success rates in production
2. Consider implementing token caching for better performance
3. Set up alerts for token generation failures
4. Regularly test both token sources to ensure continued functionality

## Conclusion

We have successfully:

1. Updated the App Certificate in the Firebase Cloud Function to `3305146df1a942e5ae0c164506e16007`
2. Confirmed that the token generation method is correctly implemented as `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithUid(appID, appCertificate, channelName, uid, userRole, expireTime)`
3. Tested the token generation locally and verified it works correctly
4. Prepared the Firebase Cloud Function for deployment (pending project upgrade to Blaze plan)

The implementation follows Agora's best practices for secure token generation, with the App Certificate stored only on the server side and never exposed in client code. The token generation system is robust, with proper parameter validation and error handling.

Once the Firebase project is upgraded to the Blaze plan, the functions can be deployed and fully tested with the Flutter app.

# Agora Call System Debugging Results

## Issues Fixed

We've addressed several issues that were causing the "Failed to start call - check your connection" error:

### 1. Token Generation and Validation

- Added extensive logging in `_generateTokenWithSupabase()` to track token generation process
- Added validation to ensure tokens are not null, empty, or suspiciously short
- Improved error handling with clear error messages
- Added logging of token prefix for debugging purposes
- Fixed the `startCall()` method to properly validate tokens before proceeding

### 2. UID Conversion

- Implemented a robust SHA-256 based `_generateNumericUidFromString()` function that:
  - Creates a consistent numeric UID from a string UID
  - Ensures the UID is within the valid 31-bit positive range for Agora
  - Has proper error handling with fallback mechanism
- Updated the Supabase Edge Function to use the same algorithm for generating numeric UIDs
- Ensured the same UID is used consistently throughout the call process

### 3. Permission Handling

- Added explicit permission checks before starting or joining calls
- Improved error messages for permission issues
- Added proper logging of permission statuses

### 4. Error Handling in joinCall()

- Added explicit try-catch blocks around the `joinChannel()` call
- Added more detailed logging before, during, and after joining a channel
- Improved error messages displayed to users

### 5. Connection State Monitoring

- Added better handling of connection state changes
- Improved logging of connection events

## Testing Steps

To verify these fixes:

1. Check token generation by printing the token in the console:
   ```dart
   print('Generated Token: ${token.substring(0, 20)}...');
   ```

2. Verify UID consistency by logging the numeric UID before joining a channel:
   ```dart
   print("Joining channel with token: ${token.substring(0, 20)}..., uid: $numericUid");
   ```

3. Test permissions by ensuring they're requested and verified:
   ```dart
   await Permission.microphone.request();
   await Permission.camera.request();
   ```

4. Catch joinChannel exceptions with proper error handling:
   ```dart
   try {
     await engine.joinChannel(
       token: token,
       channelId: channelId,
       uid: numericUid,
       options: options,
     );
   } catch (e) {
     print("‚ùå joinChannel failed: $e");
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

The call system should now be more robust with:
- Better error handling
- Consistent UID generation
- Proper token validation
- Clear logging for debugging
- Improved user feedback

If issues persist, check the logs for specific error messages which should now be much more informative.
